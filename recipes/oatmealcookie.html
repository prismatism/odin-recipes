        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This oatmeal raisin cookie recipe is guaranteed to produce some of the best cookies you've ever had. 
            Whenever I make these I always get compliments, and it's such a joy to see people go wide eyed on the first bite and then proceed to eat six more cookies.
            Even my girlfriend, who hates oatmeal cookies, likes this recipe. The secret is the balancing the tartness of the raisins with chocolate.
            The chocolate also plays really well with the toasty nutty flavor you get by roasting the oatmeal first.

            <li>1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>

            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup raisins, dried sour cherries, and/or dried cranberries</li>
            <li>1 cup chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>
                Preheat oven to 425. Spread oats on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until lightly golden, about 6 minutes.
                Add pecans, toss to combine, and continue toasting until pecans are fragrant and oats are deep brown, about 6 minutes more. Let cool slightly.
            </p>
            h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>
                Combine and whisk the dry ingredients, oats, pecans, flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a bowl.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>
                Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy.
                Add egg, syrup, and vanilla and beat until incorporated. Reduce speed to low; add dry ingredients and raisins and chocolate until just combined.
                Let sit at room temperature at least one hour to hydrate oatmeal.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>
                Preheat oven to 350 and scoop 2oz cookie portions onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet or tray.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
            <p>
                Bake cookies for 15-17 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through, until edges are golden brown.
                Let sit on sheets for 10 minutes before transfering to wire racks to cool.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 6</h4>
            <p>
                Enjoy!
