        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            After many trials of experimenting and optimizing my chocolate chip cookie recipe, this is the proud result of my trials.
            The brown butter and flaky salt take these chocolate chip cookies to the next level, but the real game changer is the extra egg yolk to give these cookies a chew like no other.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
            <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>6 oz chocolate, roughly chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe</h3>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>
                Preheat oven to 375. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda in a small bowl.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>
                Cook 1/2 cup butter into brown butter. Transfer butter to heatproof bowl, cooling slightly before adding the rest of the butter.
                Once butter is melted, add both sugars and whisk until sugar is incorporated. 
                Add egg and egg yolks and whisk until mixture is smooth. Whisk in vanilla.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>
                Using a rubber spatula, fold in dry ingredients and chocolate. 
            </p>
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>
                Scoop out portions onto parchment lined baking sheets. Bake cookies for 8-10 minutes until golden brown around edges.
            </p>
            <h4>Step 5</h4>
